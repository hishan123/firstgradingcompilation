        <h3>In order steps in cooking sinanglaw</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a deep pot, put oil then sauté garlic, onions and ginger.</li>
            <li>Add beef and brown all sides. Once brown, add the beef tendons. </li>
            <li>Add water to the pot enough to cover the meat pieces. Bring it to a boil then simmer soup for 45 minutes in low heat.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat then drain the soup using a fine sieve to have a clear broth. Set aside the meat pieces. Place clear broth on another pot together with the tendons and set aside the beef. Bring it to a boil and simmer until tendons are soft (this might take 60 to 90 minutes more) add water if needed.</li>
            <li>Add the beef, tripe, finger chillies and bile (if using). At this stage if you are using bitter gourd place it in a muslin cloth together with tamarind or kamias, wrap it well then place into the pot. Simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Press the muslin cloth over the soup to extract the juices then season with salt or fish sauce. If you want to add some leafy greens, I suggest spinach.</li> <br>
